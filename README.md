# Galaga-Trek
A Pygame that I made that turns Galaga into a Star-Trek themed game!

Instructions:
1. Make sure you have python and pygame installed.
2. Unzip the "Galaga Trek" folder into the correct space needed, as it is all the images and the font needed to play the game.
3. Run the game!

Remember that this is just a fun little game I made in my freetime, and probaby has many bugs and is very unorganized.
